## `ibm_container_bind_service`
{: #container-bind}

Bind an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service to an {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster. Service binding is a quick way to create service credentials for an IBM Cloud service by using its public service endpoint and storing these credentials in a Kubernetes secret in your cluster. The Kubernetes secret is automatically encrypted in etcd to protect your data.

To bind a service to your cluster, you must provision an instance of the service first.
{: note}

For more information, about service binding, see [Adding services by using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service binding](/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-binding). 

### Sample Terraform code
{: #container-bind-sample}

The following example binds a service with the name `myservice` to a cluster with the name `mycluster`. 

```
resource "ibm_container_bind_service" "bind_service" {
  cluster_name_id             = "mycluster"
  service_instance_name       = "myservice"
  namespace_id                = "default"

```
$ terraform import ibm_container_bind_service.example mycluster/myservice/default
```


## `ibm_container_cluster`
{: #container-cluster}

Create, update, or delete an {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} single zone cluster. Every cluster is set up with a worker pools that is named `default` and that holds worker nodes with the same configuration, such as machine type, CPU, and memory.
{: shortdesc}

If you want to use this resource to update a cluster, make sure that you review the [version changelog](/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog) for patch updates and the [version information and update information](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) for major and minor changes. 
{: important}

If you want to create a VPC cluster, make sure to include the VPC infrastructure generation in the `provider` block of your Terraform configuration file. If you do not set this value, the generation is automatically set to 2. For more information, about how to configure the `provider` block, see [Overview of required input parameters for each resource category](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-provider-reference#required-parameters). 
{: important}

You cannot create a free cluster in {{site.data.keyword.bpfull_notm}}.
{: important}

To create a worker pool or add worker nodes and zones to a worker pool, use the `ibm_container_worker_pool` and `ibm_container_worker_pool_zone` resources. 
{: tip}

| ------------- |-------------| ----- | -------------- | ------- |
|`flavor`|String|Required|The flavor of the VPC worker node that you want to use. | Yes |
|`name`|String|Required|The name of the cluster.| Yes |
|`vpc_id`|String|Required|The ID of the VPC that you want to use for your cluster. To list available VPCs, run `ibmcloud is vpcs`. | Yes |
|`zones`|List|Required|A nested block describes the zones of this VPC cluster. | No |
|`zones.subnet_id`|String|Required|The VPC subnet to assign the cluster.| Yes |
|`zones.name`|String|Required|The name of the zone| Yes |
|`disable_public_service_endpoint`|Boolean|Optional|Disable the public service endpoint to prevent public access to the Kubernetes master. Default value is 'true’.| No |
|`kube_version`|String|Optional| Specify the Kubernetes version, including the major.minor version. If you do not include this flag, the default version is used. To see available versions, run `ibmcloud ks versions`.| No |
|`update_all_workers`|Boolean|Optional| Set to true, if you want to update workers Kubernetes version with the cluster kube_version.| No |
|`pod_subnet`|String|Optional|Specify a custom subnet CIDR to provide private IP addresses for pods. The subnet must have a CIDR of at least `/23` or larger. For more information, see the [documentation](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_subnets). Default value is `172.30.0.0/16`.| Yes |
|`service_subnet`|String|Optional|Specify a custom subnet CIDR to provide private IP addresses for services. The subnet must be at least ’/24’ or larger.

|`worker_labels`|Map|Optional| Labels on all the workers in the default worker pool.| No |
|`resource_group_id`|String|Optional|The ID of the resource group. You can retrieve the value by running `ibmcloud resource groups` or by using the `ibm_resource_group` data source. If no value is provided, the `default` resource group is used. | Yes |
|`tags`|Array of strings|Optional|A list of tags that you want to associate with your VPC cluster. **Note**: For users on account to add tags to a resource, they must be assigned the [appropriate permissions]/docs/account?topic=account-access). | No |
|`cos_instance_crn`|String|Optional|Required for OpenShift clusters only. The standard cloud object storage instance CRN to back up the internal registry in your OpenShift on VPC Gen 2 cluster.| No |
|`wait_till`|String|Optional|The creation of a cluster can take a few minutes (for virtual servers) or even hours (for Bare Metal servers) to complete. To avoid long wait times when you run your Terraform code, you can specify the stage when you want Terraform to mark the cluster resource creation as completed. Depending on what stage you choose, the cluster creation might not be fully completed and continues to run in the background. However, your Terraform code can continue to run without waiting for the cluster to be fully created. Supported stages are: <ul><li><strong>MasterNodeReady</strong>: Terraform marks the creation of your cluster complete when the cluster master is in a <code>ready</code> state.</li><li><strong>OneWorkerNodeReady</strong>: Terraform marks the creation of your cluster complete when the master and at least one worker node are in a <code>ready</code> state.</li><li><strong>IngressReady</strong>: Terraform marks the creation of your cluster complete when the cluster master and all worker nodes are in a <code>ready</code> state, and the Ingress subdomain is fully set up.</li></ul> If you do not specify this option, <code>IngressReady</code> is used by default. You can set this option only when the cluster is created. If this option is set during a cluster update or deletion, the parameter is ignored by the Terraform provider. | No |

|`kms_config.instance_id`|List|Optional|The GUID of the Key Protect instance.| No |
|`kms_config.crk_id`|List|Optional|The ID of the customer root key (CRK).| No |
|`kms_config.private_endpoint`|Boolean|Optional|Set `true` to configure the KMS private service endpoint. Default value is `false`.| No |
|`entitlement`|String|Optional|The {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} cluster entitlement avoids the OCP license charges incurred. Use Cloud Pak with OCP Licence entitlement to create the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}}cluster. **NOTE** <ul><li> It is set only the first time creation of the cluster, further modifications are not impacted. </li></ul> <ul><li> Set this argument to `cloud_pak` only if you use the cluster with a Cloud Pak that has an {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} entitlement.</li></ul>| No |
| `force_delete_storage`|Boolean|Optional|If set to `true`,force the removal of persistent storage associated with the cluster during cluster deletion. Default value is `false`. **NOTE** If `force_delete_storage` parameter is used after provisioning the cluster, then, you need to execute `terraform apply` before `terraform destroy` for `force_delete_storage` parameter to take effect. | No |

**Note**

1. For users on account to add tags to a resource, you need to assign the right access. For more information, about tags, see [Tags permission](/docs/account?topic=account-access).
2. `wait_till` is set only for the first time creation of the resource, further modification are not impacted.
