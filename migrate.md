# Migrating and version controling
{: #migration-versioncontrol}

IBM continually updates the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform provider to give you higher levels of performance and being up-to-date. Some of the instances aren't able to be upgraded, so they must be closed and you must migrate your resources with the right version.

View the versions that are associated in the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provider plug-in.

## Migrating your IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform version
{: #tf-0.1x-migration}
  
Update your IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform configuration files from version 0.1x to version 0.1x so that you can run your IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform code with the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform version 0.1x. 

With the release of IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform version 0.12, the syntax for configuration files changed. If you want to run your infrastructure code by using IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform version 0.12, you must first update your configuration files to apply the new syntax. 
{: important}

1. Follow the [instructions](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-setup_cli#install_cli) to install IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform version 0.1x and the latest release of the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform. 
2. Copy your IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform version 0.1x configuration files into your IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform working directory. 
   ```
   mv <tf_config_file_path> $HOME/terraform
   ```
   {: pre}
   
3. Use the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform version 0.1x CLI to automatically apply the new syntax to your IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform configuration files. 
  
   **Syntax**
   ```
   terraform <0.xx>upgrade
   ```
   {: pre}

   **Example to upgrade IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform v0.12 to IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform v0.13**
   ```
   terraform 0.13upgrade
   ```
   {: pre}
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   This command rewrites the configuration files in the given directory so
   that they use the new syntax features from IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform v0.1x, and identify
   any constructs that may need to be adjusted for correct operation with
   IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform v0.1x.

   We recommend to use this command in a clean version control work tree, so that
   you can easily see the proposed changes as a diff against the latest commit.
   If you have uncommited changes already present, we recommend aborting this
   command and dealing with them before running this command again.

   Would you like to upgrade the module in the current directory?
     Only 'yes' is accepted to confirm.

     Enter a value: yes

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Upgrade complete!

   The configuration files were upgraded successfully. Use your version control
   system to review the proposed changes, make any necessary adjustments, and
   then commit.
   ```
   {: screen}
   
4. Open your IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform configuration file to verify the changes.
