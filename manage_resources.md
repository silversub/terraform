# Managing IBM Cloud resources with Terraform
{: #manage_resources}

Use the Terraform CLI to create your platform and infrastructure resources in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 
{: shortdesc}

## Provisioning IBM Cloud resources
{: #provision_resources}

To provision {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources, you must describe the state of your resources that you want to achieve in a configuration file.  
{: shortdesc}

Terraform configuration files are written by using the [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html) or JSON syntax. When you create your configuration file, you must describe the type of resource that you want and the state that you want to achieve for your resource. Terraform reads this configuration and creates an execution plan with the steps that were identified to achieve the specified state. If existing resources are found, Terraform identifies the necessary steps to update them. 

Before you begin: 
- [Install the Terraform CLI and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-setup_cli#setup_cli).
- [Configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in to use your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-tf-provider#configure_provider). 

The following example shows how you can configure a virtual server in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using JSON syntax. A virtual server is an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure resource that incurs costs. Be sure to review [available plans ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/virtual-server-group) before you proceed. 
{: important} 

Looking for other resource types? Find a complete list of supported resource types in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in reference](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-tf-provider). 
{: tip}

1. Create a configuration file that is named `sample.tf` with the following content. Configuration file names must have the `.tf` extension to be found by Terraform. Store this file in the same folder that you used to store your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials. 
   ```
   resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "vm1" {
    hostname = "vm1"
    domain = "example.com"
    os_reference_code = "DEBIAN_8_64"
    datacenter = "dal09"
    network_speed = 10
    hourly_billing = true
    private_network_only = false
    cores = 1
    memory = 1024
    disks = [25]
    local_disk = false
   }
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   
2. Initialize Terraform. 
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
   {: pre}
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   Initializing provider plugins...

   The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration, so the latest version was installed.

   To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings suggested.

   * provider.ibm: version = "~> 0.11"

   Terraform has been successfully initialized!

   You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work.

   If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   ```
   {: screen}
   
3. Generate a Terraform execution plan. When you execute this command, Terraform validates the syntax of your configuration file and resource definitions against the specifications that are provided by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in. 
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output: 
   ```
   Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
   The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be persisted to local or remote state storage.

   An execution plan has been generated and is shown here.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
     + create

   Terraform will perform the following actions:

   **Note** You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
   ```

4. Review the execution plan to verify the steps that were identified by Terraform to provision the virtual server.  

5. Create your infrastructure resources.  
   ```
   terraform apply

   {: pre} 
   
   Confirm the creation of infrastructure resources by entering **yes** when prompted.

## Updating IBM Cloud resources
{: #update_resources}

You can update your resources by changing your Terraform configuration file and applying these changes in your environment. 
{: shortdesc}

1. List your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. 
   ```
   terraform show
   ```
   {: pre}
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   ibm_compute_vm_instance.vm1:

   ```
   {: screen}
   
2. Open your `sample.tf` configuration file and change a value. For example, you can change the **network_speed** to **100**. To find an overview of parameters that you can change, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource reference](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-tf-provider).
   
3. Create a Terraform execution plan. 
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   {: pre}
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
   The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be persisted to local or remote state storage.

   ibm_compute_vm_instance.vm1: Refreshing state... (ID: 51404681)

   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   An execution plan has been generated and is shown here.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    ~ update in-place

   Terraform will perform the following actions:

    ~ ibm_compute_vm_instance.vm1
    network_speed: "10" => "100"

   Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
   ```
   {: screen}
   
4. Apply the changes to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. 
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
   {: pre}
   
5. Verify that your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources are updated. 
   ```
   terraform show

   {: pre}
   
2. Verify the Terraform execution plan. 
3. Remove your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. 
   ```
   terraform destroy
