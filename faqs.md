## How do I find the flavor and parameters to configure a virtual service instance in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}? 
{: #vsi_config}
{: faq}

The Terraform `ibm_compute_vm_instance` resource includes optional and mandatory configuration parameters. To find an overview of how you can configure your virtual server, use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI.  

1. Install the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli). 

2. List supported configuration options for virtual servers in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. The listed options include available data centers, machine flavors, cpu, memory, operating systems, local disk and SAN disk sizes, and network interface controllers (nic). {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} offers multiple virtual server offerings that each come with a specific configuration. The configuration of an offering is optimized for a specific workload need, such as high performance, or real-time analytics. For more information, see [Public Virtual Servers](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-public-virtual-servers).

## How long does it take for my resources to provision and delete?
{: #provisioning_times}
{: faq}

Most {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform resources provision within a few seconds. Infrastructure resources, including Bare Metal servers, virtual servers, and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Load Balancers can take longer. When you run the `terraform apply` or `terraform destroy` command, the command might take a few minutes to complete and you are not able to enter a different command during that time. The `terraform apply` command returns when your resources are fully provisioned, whereas the `terraform destroy` command might return before your resources are deleted from your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform or infrastructure portfolio. 

Use the `terraform apply` and `terraform destroy` times in the following table as a reference for when you can expect your commands to complete. 

If the Terraform operation does not complete due to a timeout, wait for the resource state change to complete and retry the operation.
