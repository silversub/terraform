You can use IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform to automate your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource provisioning, rapidly build complex, multi-tier cloud environments, and enable Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  
{: shortdesc}

Looking for a managed IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform solution? Try out [{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started). With {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}, you can use the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform scripting language that you are familiar with, but you don't have to worry about setting up and maintaining the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform CLI and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in. {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} also provides pre-defined IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform templates that you can easily install from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
{: tip}

**How does it work?**</br>
Let's say you want to spin up multiple copies of your service that uses a cluster of virtual servers, a load balancer, and a database server. You could learn how to create each resource, review the API or the commands that you need, and write a bash script to spin up these components. But it's easier, faster, and more orderly to specify the type of resource that you want and let IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform do it all for you. 

The IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform configuration files describe the resources that you need and how you want to configure them. Based on your configuration, IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform creates an execution plan and describes the actions that need to be executed to get to the required state. You can review the execution plan, change it, or simply execute the plan. When you change your configuration, IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform can determine what changed and create incremental execution plans that you can apply to your existing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. 

**What do I need to get started?**</br>
To provision {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure and platform resources, you must have a [Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).  

**What do I provision as part of this tutorial?** </br>

In this getting started tutorial, you provision a [classic infrastructure virtual server](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-public-virtual-servers) and a [VPC virtual server instance](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-getting-started). Both virtual server instances incur costs. Be sure to review the available plans for [classic infrastructure virtual servers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/virtual-server-group) and [VPC virtual server instances](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc/provision/vs) before you proceed.

Sounds great? Get started by installing the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform CLI and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in. Then, configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you want and watch IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform spin them up.

      ```
      {: screen}

      
## Configuring the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in
{: #cloud_provider_config}

IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform uses the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in to securely communicate with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} REST API. To provision and work with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources, you must configure your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in to use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials that are required to access your resource. 
{: shortdesc}

**What credentials do I need?**</br>
The credentials that you need depend on the type of resource that you want to provision. For example, to provision classic infrastructure resources, you must provide your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure user name and API key. To provision VPC infrastructure, you need an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key. For more information, about what credentials you need for a specific {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource, see [Required input parameters for each resource category](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-provider-reference#required-parameters).

**Where can I find an overview of available resources?**</br>
To find a full list of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you can provision with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in, see the [Index of IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform resources and data sources](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-index-of-terraform-resources-and-data-sources).

1. Create a folder on your local machine for your first IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform project and navigate into the folder. This folder is used to store all configuration files and variable definitions. 
   ```
   mkdir myproject && cd myproject
   ```
   {: pre}
      
2. [Create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key) to provision the VPC virtual server instance. 

3. [Generate an SSH key](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-ssh-keys). The SSH key is required to provision the VPC virtual server instance and you can use the SSH key to access your instance via SSH. After you created your SSH key, make sure to [upload this SSH key to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-managing-ssh-keys#managing-ssh-keys-with-ibm-cloud-console). 

4. [Retrieve your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure user name and API key](/docs/account?topic=account-classic_keys). You use this user name and API key to provision the classic infrastructure virtual server in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. 
        
6. Create a local IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform variables file that is named `terraform.tfvars` to store your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure credentials and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key. Make sure to save this file in the folder that you created for your first IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform project. Variables that are defined in the `terraform.tfvars` file are automatically loaded by IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform when the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform CLI is initialized and you can reference them in every IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform configuration file that you use. 

   Because the `terraform.tfvars` file contains confidential information, do not push this file to your version control system where you store the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform configuration files of the resources that you want to provision. This file is meant to be on your local system only.

7. Create an IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform provider configuration file that is named `provider.tf`. Use this file to configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in with the credentials from your `terraform.tfvars` file so that the plug-in can access and provision {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. To reference a variable from the `terraform.tfvars` file, use the syntax `var.<variable_name>`. 
   ```
   variable "ibmcloud_api_key" {}
   variable "iaas_classic_username" {}
   variable "iaas_classic_api_key" {}

   provider "ibm" {
     ibmcloud_api_key   = var.ibmcloud_api_key

## Provisioning a virtual server instance in a VPC in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #sample_vpc_config}

Use IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform to create a virtual server instance in a VPC, and set up networking for your VPC in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. 
{: shortdesc}

A VPC allows you to create your own space in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} so that you can run an isolated environment in the public cloud with custom network policies. The example in this topic provisions the following VPC infrastructure resources for you: 
- 1 VPC where you provision your VPC virtual server instance
- 1 security group and a rule for this security group to allow SSH connection to your virtual server instance
- 1 subnet to enable networking in your VPC
- 1 VPC virtual server instance 
- 1 floating IP address that you use to access your VPC virtual server instance over the public network

Keep in mind that a VPC virtual server instance is an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure resource that incurs costs. Be sure to review the [available plans ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc/provision/vs) before you proceed.
{: important}

Before you begin: 
- [Install the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform CLI and the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform](#install). 
- [Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and the CLI plug-in to work with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-cli). 
- [Retrieve your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials, upload an SSH key, and configure the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform provider plug-in](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-getting-started#cloud_provider_config). 

To create a VPC and a virtual server instance: 

1. Make sure that you have the [required permissions](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources) to create and work with VPC infrastructure. 

2. In the same directory where you stored the `terraform.tfvars` and `provider.tf` files, create an IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform configuration file and name it `vpc.tf`. The configuration file includes the following definition blocks: 
   - **locals**: Use this block to specify variables that you want to use multiple times throughout this configuration file. 
   - **resource**: Every resource block specifies the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource that you want to provision. To find more information about supported configurations for each resource, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in reference](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-setup_cli#configure_provider).
   - **data**: Use this block to retrieve information for an existing resource in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. 
   - **output**: This block specifies commands that you want to run after your resources are provisioned. 
   
   Example configuration file: 
   
   ```

3. Initialize IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform. 
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
   {: pre}
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   Initializing provider plugins...

   The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration, so the latest version was installed.

   To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings suggested.

   * provider.ibm: version = "~> 0.11"

   IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform has been successfully initialized!

   You may now begin working with IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform commands should now work.

   If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   ```

4. Generate an IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform execution plan. When you execute this command, IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform validates the syntax of your configuration file and resource definitions against the specifications that are provided by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in. 
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output: 
   ```
   Refreshing IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
   The refreshed state be used to calculate this plan, but not be
   persisted to local or remote state storage.

   An execution plan has been generated and is shown.

## Provisioning a classic infrastructure virtual server instance in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #sample_infrastructure_config}

Create your a classic infrastructure virtual service instance with IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform. Similar to the VPC virtual server instance that you provisioned earlier, you create another configuration file with the specification for your classic infrastructure virtual server instance. 
{: shortdesc}

Keep in mind that a virtual server is an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure resource that incurs costs. Be sure to review the [available plans ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/virtual-server-group) before you proceed.
{: important}

1. Create a configuration file that is named `classic-vsi.tf` with the following content. Store this file in the folder that you created earlier. 
   ```
   resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "vm1" {
   hostname             = "vm1"
   domain               = "example.com"
   os_reference_code    = "DEBIAN_8_64"
   datacenter           = "dal10"
   network_speed        = 10
   hourly_billing       = true
   private_network_only = false
   cores                = 1
   memory               = 1024
   disks                = [25]
   local_disk           = false

   terraform init
   ```
   {: pre}
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   Initializing provider plugins...

   The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration, so the latest version was installed.

   To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings suggested.

   * provider.ibm: version = "~> 0.11"

   IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform has been successfully initialized!

   You may now begin working with IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform commands should now work.

   If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands detects it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   ```
   {: screen}
   
3. Generate an IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform execution plan. When you execute this command, IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform validates the syntax of your configuration file and resource definitions against the specifications that are provided by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in. 
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output: 
   ```
   Refreshing IBM Cloud Provider plug-in for Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
   The refreshed state be used to calculate this plan, but not be persisted to local or remote state storage.

   An execution plan has been generated and is shown.
